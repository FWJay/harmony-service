# Harmony::Service

The Harmony Service gem simplifies creation of a Service in the Harmony Platform.

## Installation

1. Create a new Service via the Harmony platform
1. Download the code for your Service.
1. Run `bundle install`

## Usage

In order to test your code locally you can run `bundle exec rspec`. Once you have completed development you can upload into the Harmony Platform.

## Development

Your Service should respond to request messages appropriately. You can find the relevant mappings [here](https://github.com/HarmonyMobile/harmony-service/blob/master/lib/harmony/service/rpc_service.rb#L95).
